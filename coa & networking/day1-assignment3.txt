Assignment 3: Real-World Applications of Parallel Computing and Networked Systems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parallel Computing
________________________
Application: Weather Forecasting

	Usage: Parallel computing is used to process large-scale simulations of weather models. These simulations require complex 		calculations involving vast amounts of data collected from various sources (e.g., satellites, weather stations).
	Importance: Speed and accuracy are crucial in weather forecasting. Parallel computing allows meteorologists to run multiple 	simulations concurrently, improving the reliability and timeliness of weather predictions.

Networked Systems
______________________________
Application: Online Banking

Usage: Networked systems connect bank servers, ATMs, mobile banking apps, and online banking platforms. This integration allows real-time transactions, balance checks, fund transfers, and other banking services.

Importance: Ensures seamless and secure financial operations across different platforms and locations. Networked systems facilitate constant connectivity, ensuring that users have uninterrupted access to banking services regardless of their location.
These technologies are essential because they enhance computational efficiency (parallel computing) and connectivity (networked systems), leading to better performance, reliability, and user experience in various applications.
